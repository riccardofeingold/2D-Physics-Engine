# 🕹️ 2D Drone Maze Running Game

## 🔭 Physics2D
Inside the Physics2D folder I have implemented my own 2D physics engine that includes collision detection with AABB as broad phase method and SAT for the narrow phase. Friction 
and rotational physics are implemented as well. This engine is able to handle collision with any convex shape.

## 💡 Game
The idea of this project is to develop a 2D drone maze game where the user has to find the shortest path to the goal and fly through the parcour as fast as possible. As soon as this foundation has been set, the next step would be to add sensors. These features shall be used later to train a agent that can complete any given parcour in this game using reinforcement learning.
