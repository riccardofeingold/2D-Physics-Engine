# 🕹️ 2D Drone flight simulator

## 💡 Idea
The idea of this project is to develop a 2D drone simulator game where the user has to find the shortest path to the goal and fly through the parcour as fast as possible. As soon as this foundation has been set, the next step would be to add sensors. These features shall be used later to train a agent that can complete any given parcour in this game using reinforcement learning.
