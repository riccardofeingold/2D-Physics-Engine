# üïπÔ∏è 2D Drone Maze Running Game

## üî≠ Physics2D
Inside the Physics2D folder I have implemented my own 2D physics engine that includes collision detection with AABB as broad phase method and SAT for the narrow phase. Friction 
and rotational physics are implemented as well. This engine is able to handle collision with any convex shape. In addition to this, I have implemented ray casting to simulate the use
of a Lidar sensor.

## üî® Upcoming Possible Features
- Air drag
- Collision detection with concave shapes
- Path finding algorithm: Goal is to enable the developer to add autonomous agents that can find the shortest path to a target
- Add RL algorithms such PPO and Q-Learning
- Springs
- Enable to use textures
- Make it compatible for ROS Noetic and ROS2 Humble
- Enable noise on Lidar sensor
  - Allow more customization of the Lidar sensor
- Joint simulation
- Soft body physics
